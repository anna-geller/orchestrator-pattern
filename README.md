# Orchestrator pattern in Prefect 1.0
This repository demonstrates examples showing the flow-of-flow orchestrator pattern, which is incredibly useful for:
- building modular workflows
- data warehousing projects
- bringing more structure to complex projects by separating workflow logic into subflows
- starting only parts of a bigger workflow by triggering a specific subflow when needed
